\title{Annotate Significant Features from Differential Abundance Results from function direction}
\usage{
result_annotation(daa_result, threshold = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{daa_result}{A data frame containing the results of a differential abundance analysis. 
Must include at least the columns \code{feature} and \code{p_adjust}.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value specifying the adjusted p-value cutoff for significance. 
Defaults to \code{0.05}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of significant features with adjusted p-values below the given threshold, 
  sorted by ascending p-value.
}
\description{
This function filters and returns statistically significant features from a differential 
abundance analysis (DAA) result based on an adjusted p-value threshold.
