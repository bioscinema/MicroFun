\title{Plot signed logFC pathways for each taxon (list of plots)}
\usage{
plot_pathway_logfc(
  pathway_sdaa_result,
  top_n = 15,
  padj_cutoff = 0.05,
  wrap_width = 45
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway_sdaa_result}{A **named list** where each element is a
`data.frame` of differential results for one taxon (or function), containing
at least the columns `feature`, `logFC`, `p_adjust`, `group1`, `group2`,
and optionally `pathway_name`.}

\item{top_n}{Integer. Maximum number of bars (features) to display per plot.
The function keeps the strongest absolute effects, but always keeps
features with `p_adjust <= padj_cutoff`. Default `15`.}

\item{padj_cutoff}{Numeric. Adjusted p-value cutoff for retaining significant
features even if they are not among the top `top_n` by absolute effect.
Default `0.05`.}

\item{wrap_width}{Integer. Character width used to line-wrap labels (via
`stringr::str_wrap`). Default `45`.}
}
\value{
A named `list` of `ggplot` objects, one per entry of
  `pathway_sdaa_result`. Entries with missing or empty data are omitted.
}
\description{
Given the list returned by `pathway_sdaa()` (one data frame per taxon/function
group), make a bar plot of signed log fold-changes (logFC) for each element,
highlighting the direction of change and labeling bars with wrapped pathway
names. Returns a named list of `ggplot` objects.
}
\details{
Internally calls [plot_pathway_logfc_one()] on each element using
`label_col = "pathway_name"`; when that column is missing or empty the
function falls back to `feature`.
