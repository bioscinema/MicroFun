\title{Visualize Functional Contributions with a Sankey Diagram}
\usage{
sankey_diagram(
  pathway_sdaa_result,
  node_color = c(Up = "#79e8d0", Down = "#e8d079")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway_sdaa_result}{A named list of differential abundance results, typically the output from \code{pathway_sdaa()}.}

\item{node_color}{Named vector of colors to represent "Up" and "Down" regulated links. Default: \code{c(Up = "#79e8d0", Down = "#e8d079")}.}
}
\value{
A Sankey diagram object rendered by \code{networkD3::sankeyNetwork()}.
}
\description{
This function generates an interactive Sankey diagram to visualize the relationship
between genera and functional pathway classes, using the results from \code{pathway_sdaa()}.
}
\details{
Each genus is treated as a source node and each pathway class as a target node.
The direction of regulation is determined by the sign of \code{logFC} in the input result.
Only the primary (first-level) pathway class is retained if a hierarchy exists.

Internally, the function uses the \code{networkD3::sankeyNetwork()} function to render
an interactive diagram in the RStudio Viewer or web browser.

\examples{
\dontrun{
result <- pathway_sdaa(...)
